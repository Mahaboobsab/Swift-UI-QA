# Swift UI - QA
Consist important interview Questions &amp; Answer's

## Qestion 1:  SwiftUI - Automatic Accessibility Support
- SwiftUI provides built-in accessibility features that work automatically with minimal developer effort.
- Unlike UIKit, where you have to manually configure accessibility for each UI element,
  SwiftUI infers accessibility traits, labels, and roles based on the view type and content.
- In short, SwiftUI makes accessibility easier, faster, and more consistent by handling most of it automatically,
  while still allowing customization when needed.
  ### Comparison between UIKit & Swift UI code
 #### UIKit
 ```swift
      let button = UIButton(type: .system)
      button.setTitle("Submit", for: .normal)
      button.isAccessibilityElement = true
      button.accessibilityLabel = "Submit Button"
      button.accessibilityHint = "Submits the form"
      button.accessibilityTraits = .button
```
  #### Swift UI
```swift
      Button("Submit") {
          // Action
      }
      .accessibilityHint("Submits the form")
```
